If by some miracle I post this to my repo.... this directory is used as a smoke test

for the QEMU x64 development work.  ie.  To get the code to work in QEMU right..

I am actually debugging it here... so that I can follow what's going on.

In particular what is happening with various SEGMENT registers.
